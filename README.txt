You can safely edit titles, descriptions, and links directly in index.html.
All images currently point to local files; if a file is missing, the browser will show a broken image icon which you can fix by adding the file above.

Pages included (new design):
- index.html (home, sections + partners)
- program.html (programs overview)
- news.html (news/announcements list)

Navigation links connect among these pages inside New_Web_page only, keeping the site self-contained.
